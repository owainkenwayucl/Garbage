# Scripts for running Neil Ferguson's Covid 19 Spatial Simulator

The code is now available: https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim

This includes a Python script for running it that I don't really like.  Here is a bunch of shell scripts to run the code which I'm working out as I go.

To set up, check this code out and copy/link the `data` directory into a subdirectory of this one.  Un-`gzip` the population files in `data/populations`.
